# Introduction
In air cargo operations, unit load devices (ULDs) serve as containers for packaging items. The task of finding the best arrangement for these items is termed the bin packing problem. By optimizing this problem, air cargo analysts aim to minimize wasted space, reduce handling time, and cut operational costs.

While the bin packing problem is inherently three-dimensional, this repository focuses on solving a simplified two-dimensional vertical bin packing problem. A mixed-integer programming model is implemented using the gurobipy module to optimize a packing stragety that ensures all items are loaded while minizing the cost associated with the ULD's used.
