# Introduction
In air cargo operations, unit load devices (ULDs) serve as containers for packaging items. The task of finding the best arrangement for these items is termed the bin packaging problem. By optimizing this problem, air cargo analysts aim to minimize wasted space, reduce handling time, and cut operational costs.

While the problem is inherently three-dimensional, this repository focuses on solving a simplified two-dimensional vertical bin packing problem. The objective is to develop a mathematical linear model and optimize a packing strategy that ensures all items are loaded while minimizing the cost associated with the ULDs used.
